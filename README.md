## Farmers Registration System

This project is a frontend-only application for managing farmer registrations and displaying a dashboard. It has been bootstrapped with Create React App.

Prerequisites
Node Version Manager (NVM): Make sure you are using NVM version 20.11.0 to manage your Node.js versions.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository

bash
Copiar código
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Install Dependencies

Ensure you are using the correct Node.js version with NVM:

bash
Copiar código
nvm use 20.11.0
Install the project dependencies:

bash
Copiar código
npm install
Run the App

Start the development server:

bash
Copiar código
npm start
This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. Any lint errors will be shown in the console.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start: Runs the app in development mode.
npm test: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.
npm run build: Builds the app for production to the build folder. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
npm run eject: Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back! Ejecting will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
